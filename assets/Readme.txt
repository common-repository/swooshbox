== Description ==

Swooshbox is a slick and simple lightbox plugin, made by Roktopus Industries. We didn't like any of the lightbox effects available, so we made our own and built it into our themes. Swooshbox is a simplified standalone version of the same effect, available for free and compatible with just about any WordPress theme.

Once installed, your image links will pop up with a graceful 3D effect. With the current version, no additional setting up is necessary. Advanced options will be available in the very near future, as will support for swiping on mobiles.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/swooshbox` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. That's it. Your image links should now have Swooshbox.

(Just make sure you uninstall any other lightbox plugins that may cause a conflict.)
